**Introduction**  
This project examines the equity implications of bicycle crashes across all census tracts in Los Angeles County by analyzing demographic characteristics such as race, income, population density, vehicle ownership, and age, etc. Bicyclists are among the most vulnerable road users, and understanding how crash occurrences correlate with demographic factors can inform transportation planning and policy to enhance safety and equity. Given the diverse socioeconomic landscape of Los Angeles County, this study aims to uncover whether specific communities are disproportionately affected by bicycle crashes.

**Explanation**  
Los Angeles County is a sprawling metropolitan area with significant variations in population density, economic status, and transportation infrastructure. Factors such as vehicle ownership, race, and income levels influence travel behavior, including bicycle use and exposure to crash risk. Lower-income communities and communities of color may face greater transportation inequities due to limited bicycle infrastructure, higher traffic volumes, and systemic underinvestment in safe transportation options.
By analyzing the distribution of bicycle crashes in relation to demographic characteristics, this study seeks to answer key equity-related questions:  

- Are bicycle crashes more prevalent in lower-income or high-density neighborhoods?
- How does race correlate with bicycle crash rates across different census tracts?
- What role does vehicle ownership play in influencing bicycle crash occurrences?
- Are certain age groups more susceptible to bicycle crashes in specific communities?

Understanding these patterns will help identify disparities and support equitable transportation planning efforts in Los Angeles County.  

**Description**  
Los Angeles County serves as the study area for this analysis. The county is characterized by a complex transportation network that includes highways, arterial roads, and a growing network of bicycle lanes. However, disparities in infrastructure investment, urban form, and demographic distribution may contribute to differences in bicycle crash rates.
This study will analyze bicycle crash data from the Transportation Injury Mapping System [TIMS](https://tims.berkeley.edu/), which provides detailed crash reports including location, severity, and contributing factors. Additionally, demographic characteristics will be obtained from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/) to assess how race, income, population density, vehicle ownership, and age correlate with crash rates at the census tract level.  

**Scope**  
- **Mapping Bicycle Crashes**: Visualizing the spatial distribution of crashes across census tracts.  
- **Mapping Demographic Characteristics**: Visualizing the spatial distribution of demographic characteristics across census tracts.  
- **Equity Assessment**: Identifying statistical correlations between crash occurrences and demographic variables. Examining whether certain demographic groups disproportionately experience bicycle crashes.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Assessing differences between high-crash and low-crash census tracts to determine key risk factors.  

**Conclusion**  
This study aims to provide an evidence-based analysis of equity disparities in bicycle crash occurrences across Los Angeles County. By leveraging spatial and statistical methods, the research will highlight areas with disproportionate crash risks and provide insights for policymakers, urban planners, and advocacy groups working toward safer and more equitable transportation systems. The findings may inform targeted infrastructure investments, policy recommendations, and community engagement efforts to address disparities in bicycle safety.
